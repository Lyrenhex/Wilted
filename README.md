# Wilted
[WILT](http://wilt.fm) scrobbler for Google Play Music Desktop Player

Many thanks to [ModalSeoul](http://github.com/modalseoul) for his Chrome Scrobbler, which much of the scrobbling of this is built based off.

## Using

These instructions require that [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) is installed on your computer, and added to the path. They also assume that you've already downloaded Wilted and extracted it to a folder (if downloaded as a .zip -- extraction not needed if cloned).

1. Ensure GPMDP is loaded *before* Wilted
2. Go to the Wilted download location
3. Run `npm install` to install required dependencies
4. Run `npm start` to run Wilted.
