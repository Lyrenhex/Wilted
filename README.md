# Wilted
[WILT](http://wilt.fm) scrobbler for Google Play Music Desktop Player

Many thanks to [ModalSeoul](http://github.com/modalseoul) for his Chrome Scrobbler, which much of the scrobbling of this is built based off.

## Using

1. Make sure that in your GPMDP desktop settings you have "Enable Playback API" checked (and restart the client if you've just checked it)
2. Ensure GPMDP is loaded *before* Wilted (yeah, I need to fix that if it isn't.)
3. Go to the Wilted download location
4. Run `npm install` to install required dependencies
5. Run `npm start` to run Wilted.
